This turned out to be useful for only a couple of weeks, after which the sheer
number of cases made it impractical and a more theoretic approach had to be
employed.

This originally had its own repository, but I tarred up the .git directory and
moved its contents to my Misc repository.

=========

I'm writing the AlgebraicTable module to ease some of the more tedious aspects
of abstract algebra this term.  It's not meant to be very fast or very good.
If you decide to use it, be aware that I'm not going for anything polished.
It's quick and dirty.

I started tinkering with algebra in python last week.  This is an
object-oriented port of that effort.

Right now it is just a module.  There's nothing to run at the command line.  If
you want to use it, you must know how to code in Python.  I recommend using
IDLE or iPython, importing the module, and working with it there.
