DEPRECATED in favor of FishFace: http://github.com/wil-langford/FishFace

This is where I knocked the rust off of my Python skills and did some early
experiments with various image-handling modules before I settled on the
approach I used in FishFace.

Originally, this had its own repository.  When I created the Misc repository
to hold all my small stuff, this got added.  Rather than try to fold the git
revision history for this into the Misc repository, I just tarred up the .git
directory and stored it in this directory in case I needed it again.
